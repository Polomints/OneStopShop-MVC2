   <p>OneStopShop has evolved from modest beginnings. Starting from Ranelagh’s Sandford Lodge in 1951, The Catholic Workers College, as it was then known, 
   addressed key societal issues of the day. Lectures were led by a handful of dedicated Jesuits two nights a week, with 103 registered students in the first year. </p>
<p>Within 10 years, student numbers had dramatically increased. By 1966, nearly 1,300 students from union and management backgrounds were learning together at the 
re-branded OneStopShop. Over the next 20 years, OneStopShop assumed an educational leadership role in workforce development, industrial 
relations and social justice issues.&nbsp;</p>
